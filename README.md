  - I am currently taking my CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) course.
      I have always been sensative when it comes to my personal data being introduced to the interent.
      Because of this, I love learning the best ways possible to protect my data, and help others protect their data too. 
  - I am currently taking my PPL (Private Pilot License) course.
      I have always loved the idea of flying single prop planes across the US seeing as there is no flight restirictions between states.
      The idea of being able to freely fly over deserts, mountains and other terrains has always inspired me!

      I am currently making a ML algorithm to make ML content filters for established Discord servers. 
  - I am learning OpenCv with Arduino.
      I am making an Arduino car that moves according to hand gestures!
